            Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

            Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

            All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

            For example,
            Given "egg", "add", return true.

            Given "foo", "bar", return false.

            Given "paper", "title", return true.

            Note:
            You may assume both s and t have the same length.
