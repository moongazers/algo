        Given an m * n matrix M initialized with all 0's and several update operations.

        Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two positive integers a and b, which means M[i][j] should be added by one for all 0 <= i < a and 0 <= j < b.

        You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.

        Example 1:
        Input: 
        m = 3, n = 3
        operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: 
        Initially, M = 
        [[0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0]]

        After performing [2,2], M = 
        [[1, 1, 0],
        [1, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0]]

        After performing [3,3], M = 
        [[2, 2, 1],
        [2, 2, 1],
        [1, 1, 1]]

        So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.
        Note:
        The range of m and n is [1,40000].
        The range of a is [1,m], and the range of b is [1,n].
        The range of operations size won't exceed 10,000.
